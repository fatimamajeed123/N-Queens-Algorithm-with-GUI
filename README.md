# N-Queens Algorithm with GUI (C#)

This project implements the **N-Queens Problem** using **C#**, supporting only **4×4** and **5×5** board sizes. The algorithm utilizes **backtracking** to find valid queen placements where no two queens attack each other. A **GUI** is provided for visualization.

## Features
- Supports **4×4** and **5×5** boards.
- Uses **backtracking** for solution generation.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for easy interaction.
