# N-Queens-Algorithm-with-GUI
N-Queens Algorithm with GUI (C#)
Overview
The N-Queens Problem is a classic combinatorial problem in which N queens must be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. This implementation is built using C# and supports 4Ã—4 and 5Ã—5 boards only.

How It Works
The program utilizes the Backtracking Algorithm to find solutions.
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to visualize the placement of queens.
Users can select between 4Ã—4 and 5Ã—5 board sizes.
The program displays valid board configurations where queens do not threaten each other.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C#
GUI Framework: Windows Forms (WinForms) / WPF (Mention which one is used)
Algorithm: Backtracking
